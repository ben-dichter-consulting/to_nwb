# to_nwb (LEGACY)
An old collection of scripts for converting datasets to NWB.

This code is now largely distributed modularly across the '<name_of_lab>-to-nwb' repositories, or otherwise available in the current API of the [NWB Conversion Tools](https://github.com/catalystneuro/nwb-conversion-tools) project.
